## The Lost Thread by Liuliu Zhu & Polina Fihman
*The Lost Thread* is a VR Game project created for the Possible Bodies workshop, a collaboration between the [Master Media Design](https://www.hesge.ch/head/en/programs-research/master-arts-media-design) ([HEAD – Genève](https://www.hesge.ch/head/en/)) and [Swiss Paraplegic Group](https://www.paraplegie.ch/en/).

The five-week workshop focused on creating playful, immersive virtual reality experiences to facilitate the rehabilitation of people with motor difficulties. Our mission in this project was to develop unique prototypes that use immersive gameplay to explore new potentials for rehabilitation. Six functional and semi-functional virtual reality prototypes have been created.

### Project Description
The Lost Thread is a VR game designed for players with physical mobility limitations, specifically paraplegics. The experience eliminates the need for handheld controllers and is entirely navigated through gentle head movements. 

Set along the mythological Sanzu River—a symbolic threshold between life and death—the game positions the player as a disembodied head. The design draws from the Chinese folklore figure Feitouman, a flying head detached from the body, who doesn’t have hands, cannot touch the world, and has to rely on hearing: echoes of forgotten melodies in the air.

Gameplay centers on sound-based interaction: players find objects and characters, guided only by sound cues. This emphasizes the ability of paralyzed people to be attentive to sound and uses sense as a key gameplay mechanism. 

While offering a full, challenging gameplay experience, The Lost Thread also provides a gentle and immersive world built for players with mobility impairments — a space to engage, enjoy, and simply exist within nature.
